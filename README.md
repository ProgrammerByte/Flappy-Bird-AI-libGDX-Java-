# Flappy-Bird-AI-libGDX-Java-
My first LibGDX project as well as one of my first proper Java projects after practising Java for a few weeks. I have recreated the game flappy bird with a basic AI included.


Controls:                                                              
A - Toggle AI mode on and off                                          
Q - Quit                                                                        
Left mouse click / Up arrow / Space - Flap / Start / Retry   (Note you cannot flap whilst the AI is playing).
